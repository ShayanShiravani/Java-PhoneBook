# Java-PhoneBook
My first Java project.

## About
This very simple application is implemented in 2015 (When I was undergraduate student🙂).<br/>
I used `JavaFX` platform to develop this project.<br/>
In this application you can define contacts and also group them together. Each contact has personal information such as first name, last name and several phone numbers, addresses and emails.<br/>
This project isn't connected to any data source, so your data will be lost after closing it.
